        The Work Order Tracking System (WOTS) was originally created for
        CenterPoint Energy (CNP) GIS employees to track the work order flow, but
        now it is widely used by GIS, Work Order Management (WOM), Operation,
        Engineering, Compliance, and Leadership to track Gas, Electric, Major
        Underground and Landbase requests, work orders and data corrections
        submitted for digitizing into GIS. Requests are primarily submitted by
        internal company employees as work orders to digitize. CNP and Contract
        personnel use the application for data entry, QC, problem resolution,
        work assignment, progress tracking and reporting.
